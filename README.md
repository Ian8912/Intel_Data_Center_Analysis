# Intel_Data_Center_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was conducted to help Intel's Sustainability Team determine the optimal location for a new data center by analyzing energy production data from different U.S. regions. The analysis focuses on which regions produce a surplus of energy, renewable energy trends, and overall energy efficiency.

## Objectives

- Identify regions in the U.S. with the highest energy production surplus.
- Analyze renewable energy reliance and net production by region.
- Provide insights to guide the decision for Intel's new data center location.

## Data Set Descriptions

This project used 3 different datasets that each separately contained information about daily energy production and consumption by region, contained information about power plants in the U.S., and contained total energy production information for each plant.

The datasets can be found in the [Dataset Descriptions](Dataset_Descriptions.md)
