# Intel Data Center Project

![Intel Logo]("Intel Data Center Logo.png")

## Introduction:

Intel, the semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse, is planning on building a new data center. Energy availability and usage are some of the key considerations in deciding on a location of the data center. For example, which regions produce a surplus of energy, and are therefore more likely to provide energy at cheaper prices? Which regions rely more on renewable energy sources?

In this project, co-designed with Intel's Sustainability Team, you'll write SQL queries that wil power your analysis and create visualizations that will help the Intel team select the best location to the new data center.
